Bitverse-unity-gui, aka **bit-gui**, allows developers to visually edit the gui layout, skin and animation using the unity3d editor.

It works on top of the default immediate mode gui from unity3d engine, but it is not immediate mode, it is more like a traditional component based frameworks.

Layout, skin and animation may be packaged in unity3d prefabs, scenes and assetbundles and treated as assets of your game development pipeline.

You may also want to look the [unityforms](http://code.google.com/p/unityforms/) from Marcelo Roca. It has a `WinForms` like approach.
